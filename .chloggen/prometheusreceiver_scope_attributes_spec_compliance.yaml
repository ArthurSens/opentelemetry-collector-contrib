  The OpenTelemetry Prometheus specification has been updated to deprecate the `otel_scope_info` metric 
  in favor of embedding scope attributes directly in metrics using `otel_scope_` prefixed labels.
  A new feature gate `receiver.prometheusreceiver.RemoveScopeInfo` controls this behavior:
  - When enabled (new behavior): scope attributes are extracted from `otel_scope_` prefixed labels on all metrics
  - When disabled (legacy behavior): scope attributes continue to be extracted from the `otel_scope_info` metric
  This change maintains backward compatibility while enabling compliance with the updated specification.
