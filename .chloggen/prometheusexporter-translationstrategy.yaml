  The new `translation_strategy` configuration replaces the `add_metric_suffixes` option and provides four strategies:
  - `UnderscoreEscapingWithSuffixes` (default): Fully escapes metric names and includes type/unit suffixes
  - `UnderscoreEscapingWithoutSuffixes`: Escapes special characters but omits suffixes  
  - `NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes`: Preserves UTF-8 characters and includes suffixes
  - `NoTranslation`: Bypasses all translation
  This change is being implemented through the `exporter.prometheusexporter.UseTranslationStrategy` feature gate to comply with OpenTelemetry specification changes. The existing `add_metric_suffixes` configuration remains supported but is deprecated when the feature gate is enabled.
